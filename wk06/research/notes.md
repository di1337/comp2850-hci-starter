# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: [2025-11-24 14:10]
**Context**: Prefers dark mode, laptop user
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

---

### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**:
'I try to use a task manager every day, especially when I know that I have something important due (like coursework)'
- If nothing is due like coursework or an important event, often doesn't use it.

**Observations**:
The person uses a task manager only for tasks with a hard deadline, not for anything else (like recreational). For example, they don't use it for 'Read for 10 minutes today', 'Go gym for Push day' etc.

**Themes**: [deadline-driven-usage], [selective-adoption], [academic-priorities]

---

### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**:
Many task manager applications feel 'bloated' with unneccesary/paid features.

**Observations**:
Participant wants a 'minimalistic' aesthetic, potentially so that it doesn't distract them.

**Themes**: [feature-bloat], [minimalism], [distraction-avoidance]

---

### Q3: Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?
**Response**:
'Yes, I forgot to submit my worksheet because other things got in the way' 'I had to meet many of my friends on that day, so I was quite busy'

**Observations**:
Since participant doesn't use the task manager to plan other 'less important' events that have no deadline, they had no actual time to submit their worksheet.

**Themes**: [time-blindness], [context-switching]

---

### Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response**:
'Never' 'I won't be able to since I don't know keyboard shortcuts for most things'

**Observations**:
Always uses a mouse. Maybe better keyboard accessibility (shows shortcuts next to buttons) would encourage them to use the app more often.

**Themes**: [accessibility-barriers], [keyboard-usability]

---

### Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?
**Response**:
'Sometimes the lights are too bright in the room, which makes the screen hard to see'
The participant would feel discouraged to work on their laptop in such conditions

**Observations**:
Minimalisation of the effects of such poor working conditions should be prioritised. Maybe a high contrast colour scheme to improve visibility.

**Themes**: [visual-accessibility], [environmental-constraints], [contrast], [readability]

---

### Q6: If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**:
'I would actually remove features, a lot of the apps feel very cluttered with too many features. It feels daunting to use some of them.'

**Observations**:
Too many features and over-engineering the app is actually counter-productive. A task manager app should just do it's core job really well.

**Themes**: [simplicity-over-features], [reduced-cognitive-load], [focus-on-core-functionality]

---


## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Too many features (bloatware)
2. Difficulty when using in harsh lighting conditions

**Job story ideas**:
- 'When I’m managing university work alongside a busy social schedule, I want a simple, distraction-free task manager that clearly supports deadline-driven work without overwhelming me, so I can reliably submit important coursework on time even when my day is full or my working conditions aren’t ideal.'

------------------------------------------------

## Participant B
**Date**: [2025-12-05 17:05]
**Context**: [Uses light mode by default, Laptop + external monitor]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

---

### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**:
'I used it last night to plan what I needed to do today. I usually check it in the evening or first thing in the morning.'

**Observations**:
Uses task manager as a planning tool rather than just a reminder for deadlines.

**Themes**: [daily-planning], [routine-building]

---

### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**:
'I spend more time organising tasks than actually doing them. I keep tweaking priorities and moving things around.'

**Observations**:
Over-organisation leads to procrastination and friction.

**Themes**: [over-management]

---

### Q3: Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?
**Response**:
'Yeah, I missed a COMP2850 lab prep because I marked it as ‘low priority’ and forgot about it until the day before.'

**Observations**:
Self-assigned priorities are unreliable and can hide important work.

**Themes**: [misleading-priorities], [human-error]

---

### Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response**:
'Yes, quite often on the train. If an app has good keyboard shortcuts, I’m much more likely to use it.'

**Observations**:
Keyboard efficiency directly affects continued usage in mobile contexts.

**Themes**: [keyboard-usability]

---

### Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?
**Response**:
'In bright rooms, subtle colours and small text are hard to read. I sometimes increase zoom just to see properly.'

**Observations**:
Users adapt manually when visual accessibility is poor.

**Themes**: [visual-accessibility] [environmental-constraints] [contrast] [readability]

---

### Q6: If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**:
'I’d want smarter defaults, like automatically suggesting priorities instead of me having to decide everything.'

**Observations**:
Wants guidance rather than more controls.

**Themes**: [support], [automation]

---


## Summary (Participant B)
**Top pain points**:
1. Excessive task organisation causes friction and procrastination.
2. Visual inefficiencies reduce usability in non-ideal environments.

**Job story ideas**:
- 'When I’m planning my day as a student, I want my task manager to guide prioritisation with minimal effort so I can focus more on actually doing the work rather than organising it.'

--------------------------------------

## Participant C
**Date**: 2025-12-05 17:30
**Context**: Laptop user, frequently switches between apps while working
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

---

### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**:
'I used it this morning, mainly just to write things down quickly.'
They explained that they usually add tasks but don’t check the list very often after that.

**Observations**:
Uses the task manager more as a place to capture tasks than to guide daily work.

**Themes**: [task-capture]

---

### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**:
'It feels disconnected from what I’m actually doing.'
They often forget about tasks once they start coding or reading in another app.

**Observations**:
Planning and execution happen in separate tools.

**Themes**: [context-switching], [tool-fragmentation]

---

### Q3: Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?
**Response**:
'Yes, I remembered a deadline while I was already deep into another assignment.'
Switching tasks at that point felt stressful and broke their focus.

**Observations**:
Late reminders disrupt flow and increase stress.

**Themes**: [flow-disruption], [interruption-cost]

---

### Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response**:
'Not really. I always use a mouse or trackpad.'
They said that without a mouse they would struggle to use most apps properly, since they don’t know many keyboard shortcuts and rely heavily on clicking.

**Observations**:
Heavy dependence on mouse-based interaction, lack of keyboard support could limit use in constrained environments.

**Themes**: [mouse-dependence], [keyboard-accessibility]


---

### Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?
**Response**:
'Late at night, switching between bright and dark screens strains my eyes.'
The applicant uses many different apps, which of course have different themes and aesthetics. The issues are amplified at night when the eyes are easily strained

**Observations**:
Visual inconsistency across apps affects comfort.

**Themes**: [visual-consistency], [eye-strain]

---

### Q6: If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**:
'I’d want tasks to be closer to the actual work, not in a separate app.'

**Observations**:
Prefers integration over adding new features.

**Themes**: [workflow-integration]

---

## Summary (Participant C)

**Top pain points**:
1. Tasks feel detached from where work actually happens.
2. Frequent context switching breaks focus and flow.

**Job story ideas**:
- 'When I’m working across multiple apps, I want my tasks to stay connected to my current work so I don’t lose focus or forget important things.'

## Participant D
**Date**: 2025-12-06 14:30
**Context**: Laptop user, studies mostly in the library, notifications always enabled
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

---

### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**:
'I checked it this morning because I saw a notification pop up.'
They explained that they usually only open the app when they are reminded by a notification rather than checking it proactively.

**Observations**:
Usage is reactive and driven by alerts rather than intentional planning.

**Themes**:
[reactive-behaviour]

---

### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**:
'It stresses me out when I open it and see loads of overdue tasks.'
They mentioned that once tasks become overdue, they often avoid opening the app altogether.

**Observations**:
Task managers can increase anxiety instead of reducing it.

**Themes**:
[task-anxiety], [avoidance-behaviour]

---

### Q3: Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?
**Response**:
'Yes, I kept postponing a coursework task until it felt too big to start.'
They said the task stayed on the list for weeks, becoming more stressful over time.

**Observations**:
Large or vague tasks discourage engagement and can lead to procrastination.

**Themes**:
[procrastination], [task-overwhelm]

---

### Q4: Do you ever work without a mouse (trackpad broken, on train)? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response**:
'Sometimes on the train I just use my keyboard.'
In those situations, they avoid apps that require a lot of clicking and tend to ignore their task manager.

**Observations**:
High interaction cost reduces usage in mobile or constrained environments.

**Themes**:
[interaction-friction], [mobile-constraints], [keyboard-accessibility]

---

### Q5: Have you used a task manager with your eyes closed or in bright sunlight? What was hard?
**Response**:
'In bright rooms, the notifications and highlights feel a bit harsh.'
They said this adds to the feeling of being overwhelmed rather than helping them focus.

**Observations**:
Visual intensity can amplify stress.

**Themes**:
[visual-overstimulation], [accessibility]

---

### Q6: If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**:
'I’d want it to be more forgiving, like breaking tasks down automatically or not shouting at me for being late.'

**Observations**:
User wants emotional support and guidance, not pressure.

**Themes**:
[gentle-guidance], [emotional-design]

---

## Summary (Participant D)

**Top pain points**:
1. Overdue tasks and notifications increase anxiety and avoidance.
2. Large, unstructured tasks feel overwhelming and hard to start.

**Job story ideas**:
- 'When I fall behind on my tasks as a student, I want my task manager to respond in a calm and supportive way so that I feel encouraged to start again rather than guilty or stressed.'
